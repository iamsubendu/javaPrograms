Object

An object is an instance of a class. It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). Objects represent real-world entities and are created from class blueprints.

=======================

Abstract Class

Classes which don't have real time representation.
It is meant to be subclassed by other classes.

dog/cat class is normal class.
Animal is abstract class as it don't have reference in real world.

For superClass we can create a abstract class.

Can contain abstract methods, concrete methods (with implementations), instance variables, constructors, and constants.

=======================

Interfaces

It defines a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.

Can only contain abstract methods, default methods (with implementations), static methods, and constants.

Cannot have instance variables (fields) other than constants.

=======================

Getters & Setters

Getters and setters are methods used to access and modify the private fields (instance variables) of a class. They provide a way to encapsulate the internal state of an object and control how the values of its fields are accessed and modified.
